# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Probabilistic prediction is a method to forecast future uncertain events and development by generating probability prediction distribution. Base on the available information set, to maximize the sharpness of prediction distribution and subject to calibrate. (Gneiting & Katzfuss, 2014) Comparing the point forecasts can produce a single point result, such as predicted a stock price in the next day, probabilistic prediction can supply more information to the forecaster by assigning a probability distribution to each future possible outcome as supplying the probabilistic distribution on different prices on the second day. Obviously, probabilistic forecasting has more obvious advantages than point forecasting, so people begin to use probabilistic forecasts to predict activities rather than using point forecasts in many fields, such as finance, weather, medicine etc. For evaluating the results of probabilistic forecasting, the methods used to evaluate the results of point prediction cannot be effectively applied. Therefore, the scoring rules are used.

In this report, we will explain probability forecasts, sharpness and calibration at section 2. About the proper scoring rules and their formulas will be introduced in section 3. And in the next section, we will learn how to use the scoring rules to evaluate the results of probability prediction by using two case studies. In these two case studies, the forecasts all based on the Gaussian prediction distribution.
