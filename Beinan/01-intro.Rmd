# Introduction {#ch:intro}

In this world, people wish to understand the future development from different events. For example, residents want to know tomorrowâ€™s weather and temperatures to decide what kind of clothes they need to choose. Securities investors want to know the future price trend of securities in order to formulate a suitable investment portfolio. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for humans to predict the future because uncertainty is a universal feature of this world. Although we have a variety of ways to predict future events, such as building suitable time series models based on past information, then predicting future trends over time, none of these methods provide absolutely accurate future predictions. The limitations are that, first of all, various activities and phenomena in the real world are difficult to be perfectly represented by mathematical models, especially humanistic phenomena such as the purchase of lottery tickets (the outcome of the lottery is random). Although there are some natural phenomena, they have certain rules to follow, such as temperature have seasonal changes, so it is very difficult to establish prediction models for them. Second, human cognition is limited. For the an event, people cannot collect and obtain all of information for the relevant factors. Because of these limitations, using these methods to make predictions must not be absolutely accurate. For now, to accurate forecast future is still a difficult task, but as more and more prediction methods and models are developed, forecasters can use them to get what they want. The following problem is how to evaluate these models, because choosing the correct assessment method can effectively compare the accuracy of forecast results by using different models, then the forecaster can obtain the most suitable prediction model.

In choosing the forecast method, point forecast is the most commonly used. But forecasts should be probabilistic (@GK14) and point estimation gradually transform to distribution estimation (@S75). Therefore, interval forecasts and probabilistic are being used more and more frequently. Probabilistic prediction is a method to forecast future uncertain events and development by generating probability prediction distribution. Base on the available information set, to maximize the sharpness of prediction distribution and subject to calibrate. (@GK14) Comparing the point forecasts can produce a single point result, such as predicted a stock price in the next day, probabilistic prediction can supply more information to the forecaster by assigning a probability distribution to each future possible outcome as supplying the probabilistic distribution on different prices on the second day. Obviously, probabilistic forecasting has more obvious advantages than point forecasting, so people begin to use probabilistic forecasts to predict activities rather than using point forecasts in many fields, such as finance, weather, medicine etc. In the @R16 paper, it discussed five potential predictors who have a need for probability forecasts.

For evaluating the accuracy of point forecast results, the common ways are to calculate the forecast errors, scale-dependent errors (as Mean absolute error, Root mean squared error), percentage errors (as Mean absolute percentage error) or scale errors (as mean absolute scaled error) (@RA18). But for interval forecasts and probabilistic forecasts, the scoring rules are used more generally. At present, scoring rules are mainly used in weather forecasting system. They provide such an assessment by giving a numerical score based on probability and actual observation (@W96) and proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to conduct careful assessment and honesty (@GR07). 

This thesis introduces the scoring rules in Chapter 2. In this Chapter, probability forecasts, sharpness and calibration is reviewed. Also interval scoring rules and distribution scoring rules are reviewed separately, and they are applied to evaluate interval forecasts and probability forecasts respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding formula and derived formula are shown in Chapter 2.1 and 2.2. In the third chapter, after using two different models to fit the financial data, interval forecast and probabilistic forecast are performed separately. Then the prediction results are evaluated by using suitable interval scoring rules and distribute scoring rules.In the same way, in Chapter 4, we select M3 data sets that have more abundant data types, and choose more different models to make forecasts, then to evaluate.
